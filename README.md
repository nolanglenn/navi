Navi is a Discord bot for the New Game Plus Podcast server. It allows users to search for retro games using the IGDB API to find out if the games are eligible for the 15 year old or older criteria set by the Retro Master List.

## How to use

Use the bot prefix and command followed by the game you want to search.

Example:

```bash
.search ghosts n goblins
```

Will result in:

The bot will also query the [Retro Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NbroYVwlp2PLZHA_12nCgbKQ0_Dov7LqClDs4rtKPZ4/edit#gid=0) and tell the user if it is already on the list.

## Future Improvement(s)

- Allow users to react to the embed to automatically add the game to the RML.
